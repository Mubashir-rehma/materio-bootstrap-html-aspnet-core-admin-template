## Support 👨‍💻

We use GitHub issues as support tickets to manage Item support.

1. In order to raise the GitHub issue, you must have our Premium Item repository access. [Get repo access](https://tools.themeselection.com/github/github-access).
2. Make sure you use our [Raise Support](https://themeselection.com/tools/github/raise-support) form to create an issue.

## Why forking is disabled? 🔒

You will lose repository access when your support expires. If you have forked the repo and you lose the access to our repo then your fork also got deleted by GitHub.

Hence, as precautions we disabled forking our repo.

**Solution**

However, you can still keep your repo even after your support expires by setting our repo as upstream:

1. Create a new **private repo** in your GitHub. Make sure it's a private repo. You can't share our code publicly as per license.
2. Clone our repo: `git clone $product_repo_url`
3. Navigate to cloned directory
4. Remove our repo as origin by running command: `git remote remove origin`
5. Add your newly created repo as origin by running command: `git remote add origin YOUR_NEWLY_CREATE_REPO_GIT_URL`
5. Add our repo as upstream by running command: `git remote add upstream $product_repo_url`
6. Push the code to GitHub by running command: `git push -u origin main`

Now, whenever you want to pull the latest changes from our repo just pull the changes by running command: `git pull upstream main`

Cheers 🥂
